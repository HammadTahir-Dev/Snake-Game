Snake Game in Java

This project is a classic Snake Game built using Java. It recreates the original gameplay experience where the snake moves around the board, eats food to grow longer, and the game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls. The game highlights core concepts of Java programming, logic building, and simple game development.

Features
- Snake moves smoothly across the game board  
- Food spawns randomly on the screen  
- Snake grows in length when food is eaten  
- Game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself  
- Score increases as the snake eats food  

How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the project in any Java-supported IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).  
3. Compile and run the main Java file.  
4. Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.  

Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later  
- A Java IDE or terminal to compile and run the program  

Future Improvements
- Add different levels with increasing difficulty  
- Include background music and sound effects  
- Improve the user interface with graphics and themes  
- Add a high-score tracker  

Project Purpose
This project was created to practice Java programming, object-oriented concepts, and game development basics. It serves as a fun way to improve coding skills while building a nostalgic game.
